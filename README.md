![Playback speed controls](/screenshot.png "Additional playback speed controls")

Simple Chrome extension that adds buttons to the HTML5 video player on www.youtube.com videos to control the playback speed to: .5x, 1x, 1.5x and 2x.

I love the functionality provided to me by my mobile podcast player apps, particularly the ability to listen to a podcast in 1.5 or 2x speed. I've always wanted to do the same for certain, longer YouTube vidoes, particularly conference messages or lectures.

This was a quick and dirty response to my simple need.

##How to install:
1. [Download](https://github.com/chrisbalt/SpeedTube/archive/master.zip) this repo or clone into a directory of your choice
2. Unzip (if not cloned)
3. In Chrome, navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Click the ''Load unpacked extension...'' button
5. Select the unzipped (or cloned) directory

###Note:

You must be using the HTML5 video player on YouTube. If anyone knows how to force use of the HTML5 video player, I'd love your help.

Improvements and enhancements are welcome and encouraged!
