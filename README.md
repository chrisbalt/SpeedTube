## SpeedTube

![Playback speed controls](/screenshot.png "Additional playback speed controls")

Simple Chrome extension that adds buttons to the HTML5 video player on
//www.youtube.com videos to control the playback speed to: .5x, 1x,
1.5x and 2x.

I love the functionality provided to me by my mobile podcast player
apps, particularly the ability to listen to a podcast in 1.5 or 2x speed.
I've always wanted to do the same for certain, longer YouTube vidoes,
particularly conference messages or lectures.

This was a quick and dirty response to my simple need.

###Note:

You must be using the HTML5 video player on YouTube. If anyone knows how
to force use of the HTML5 video player, I'd love your help.

Improvements and enhancements are welcome and encouraged!
